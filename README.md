## 

I'm 19 and I enjoy coding, management, artwork, and animation. Born in 2005 in LA, but raised a Texan. I believe coding is an ongoing learning experience because you never stop learning. 

I used to make and code Minecraft servers, now I've moved on from that, and now I'm making a game called "Brann's Burrow: Tails from the Den" -- check it out if you want.
