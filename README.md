I'm an 18 year old woman who enjoys coding, management, artwork, and animation. I was born June 15, 2005. Born in LA, raised a Texan (what a twist of fate). I believe coding is an ONGOING learning experience because you never stop learning. I have dabbled into Roblox Lua, Java, discord.js, and C#. Though, most of my skills are just in Java and C#. I've always wanted to make a game, and subconsciously I've spent the last decade expanding my skillset into artwork, animation, then into coding, UI & graphic design, then developing skills in marketing and branding. I feel confident enough to put those skills to use now. I'm currently working on **Project Florial**, please check it out even though it's still in its very early stages of development.
